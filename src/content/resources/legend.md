# Legend & Taxonomy

## How to read these docs
This documentation uses specific statuses and maturity levels to indicate the stability and reliability of the content. Use this legend to understand the state of each document.

## Status Definitions

| Status | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Draft** | Internal only, subject to major rewrites. |
| **Proposed** | Open for community RFC, content is stable but consensus is pending. |
| **Live** | Ratified standard. |
| **Deprecated** | No longer recommended; replaced by newer patterns. |

## Maturity Levels

| Maturity | Definition |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Experimental** | Emerging pattern, high risk of change, "use at own risk." |
| **Standard** | Proven in production, stable API/Structure. |

## Core Categories

### Concepts
**"The Why."** Foundational theory and mental models. These are immutable ideas (e.g., "Levels of Autonomy") that explain the philosophy behind the ASDLC.

### Patterns
**"The Structure."** Architectural templates and relationships. These are reusable solutions to common problems (e.g., "Supervisor Agent", "Context Gates") that explain the topology of agentic systems.

### Practices
**"The How."** Concrete implementation guides and specs. These are specifications and recipes (e.g., "AGENTS.md Spec") that explain the workflow and execution standards.
