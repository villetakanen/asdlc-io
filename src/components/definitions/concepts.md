title: Concepts
---
Concepts represent the **theoretical foundations** of the Agentic SDLC. They are immutable ideas and philosophies that underpin the entire system. Think of this as the "Physics" of the domain.

**What belongs here:**
- Fundamental principles (e.g., "Levels of Autonomy").
- Theoretical models and abstractions.
- Explanations of "Why" things work the way they do.
- content that is unlikely to change with technology shifts.
