title: Practices
---
Practices are **execution standards** and concrete recipes for implementation. They provide specifications, workflows, and "how-to" guides. Think of this as the "Construction" of the domain.

**What belongs here:**
- Concrete specifications (e.g., "AGENTS.md Spec").
- Step-by-step implementation guides.
- Operational workflows and checklists.
- Code-level examples and standards.
