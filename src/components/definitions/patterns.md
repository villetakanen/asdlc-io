title: Patterns
---
Patterns are **reusable architectural designs** and structural solutions to common problems. They describe the topology and relationships between agents and systems. Think of this as the "Engineering" of the domain.

**What belongs here:**
- Architectural topologies (e.g., "Supervisor Agent", "Context Gates").
- Common interaction models between components.
- Solutions to recurring design challenges.
- Structural diagrams and flow descriptions.
