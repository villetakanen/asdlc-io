    <section>
      <p>
        For 50 years, software development has been a <strong>Craft</strong>: dependent on individual artisans, manual tooling, and implicit knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        We believe the next era of software engineering is <strong>Industrial</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        ASDLC.io documents the principles, patterns, and standards required to make this transition. We are not building "AI coding assistants" that make a craftsman 10% faster. We are building the blueprints for the <strong>software factory</strong>—systems where agents serve as the architecture of labor, and humans design, govern, and optimize the flow.

      <h2>The Problem: Two Misguided Narratives</h2>

      <h3>The "Faster Horse" Fallacy</h3>
      <p>
        Copilots give developers faster hands via autocomplete and chat. This is <strong>tooling optimization</strong>—akin to giving a blacksmith a powered hammer. It creates local efficiency but does not solve systemic bottlenecks: context switching, communication overhead, technical debt.
      </p>

      <h3>The "Replacement" Fantasy</h3>
      <p>
        The "Agentic Workforce" narrative suggests agents will replace human employees one-for-one. This fundamentally misunderstands industrialization.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Agents do not replace humans; they industrialize execution.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Just as robotic arms automate welding without replacing manufacturing expertise, agents automate high-friction parts of knowledge work (logistics, syntax, verification) while humans focus on intent, architecture, and governance.

      <h2>The Solution: The Agentic Factory</h2>
      <p>
        ASDLC is the framework for <strong>Agentic Operating Models</strong>. In this model:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Agents are the logistic layer.</strong> They move information, verify specs, generate documentation, and execute tests.</li>
        <li><strong>Context is the supply chain.</strong> Requirements, schemas, and code must be delivered Just-in-Time to the right station.</li>
        <li><strong>Standardization is mandatory.</strong> A factory cannot run on ambiguous "vibes." It requires schemas, typed interfaces, and deterministic protocols.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>The Three Pillars</h3>

      <h4>I. Factory Architecture (Orchestration)</h4>
      <p>
        Structure projects where agents act as connective tissue. Move from monolithic context windows to discrete, specialized stations: Planning, Spec-Definition, Implementation, Review.
      </p>

      <h4>II. Standardized Parts (Determinism)</h4>
      <p>
        Industrialization requires interchangeable parts. In software, these are <strong>Schemas</strong>. Agents don't guess; they fulfill contracts. <code>AGENTS.md</code>, specs, and strict linting serve as the "jigs" and "molds" that constrain agent output.
      </p>

      <h4>III. Quality Control (Governance)</h4>
      <p>
        Inspection is automated and rigorous. Move from "Code Review" to "System Eval." Probabilistic tests and Human-in-the-Loop gates ensure a Senior Engineer can trust the <em>process</em>, not just the output.
