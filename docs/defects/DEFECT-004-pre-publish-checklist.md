Critical issues we want to fix before publishing the ASDLC.io alpha.
1. We do not mention anywhere that the project is (public) alpha. This is important for setting user expectations.
2. The tailer says "ASDLC Knowledge Base © 2025", the mention about "knowledge base" is a hallucination as the project name is just ASDLC.io
3. We are publishing everything under MIT license, this should be mentioned in the footer as well - instead of just the copyright (which is moot, as lots of the content is generated, even if it's curated (lists and collections have copyright, too))
4. Supervisor Agent pattern is marked as approved, but it's just a draft in the content - we mark it as experimental until we have a proper approved version.
