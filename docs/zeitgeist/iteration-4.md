# Iteration 4: The "Avionics" Overhaul

**Status**: Planning
**Start Date**: 2025-11-26
**Theme**: Industrial Precision & Authority

## Overview
Iteration 4 focuses on establishing a distinct visual identity for ASDLC.io. We are moving away from the generic SaaS aesthetic to a "Flight Manual" / "Industrial Specification" look. This aligns with the authoritative nature of the content.

## Goals
- [ ] Implement PBI-0009: "Avionics" Industrial Design System.
- [ ] Refactor core layout components to support the new design system.
- [ ] Ensure all existing documentation pages render correctly with the new typography and layout.

## Active PBIs
- [ ] [PBI-0009: Avionics Design System](../backlog/PBI-0009-Avionics-Design-System.md)

## Retrospective (Iteration 3)
-   *To be filled at the end of the iteration.*
