# PBI-0011: Content - Levels of Autonomy

**Status**: Draft
**Priority**: Medium
**Epic**: Content Expansion
**Tags**: Content, Taxonomy, Standards

## 1. User Story
As a reader of ASDLC.io,
I want to understand the "Levels of Autonomy" scale (L1-L5),
So that I can understand why ASDLC targets L3 (Conditional Autonomy) and avoids the risks of L4.

## 2. Content Specifications

### Metadata
-   **Title**: Levels of Autonomy
-   **Description**: A taxonomy of agentic behavior in software engineering, ranging from assistive tools (L1) to fully autonomous engineers (L5), with ASDLC standardized on L3 (Conditional Autonomy).
-   **Tags**: Taxonomy, Standards
-   **Related Concepts**: agentic-sdlc, guardrails, context-gates
-   **Maturity**: Standard
-   **Last Updated**: 2025-11-26

### Body Content Structure
1.  **Definition**: Explanation of the scale and its role in ASDLC.
2.  **The ASDLC Standard: L3**: Why we target L3 over L5.
3.  **The Scale**: Table defining L1-L5 (Designation, Description, Human Role, Failure Mode).
4.  **Analogy: The Self-Driving Standard (SAE)**: Comparison table to SAE J3016.
5.  **The Uncanny Valley (L4)**: Warning against L4 "Silent Drift".
6.  **Guideline**: Remain at L3.
