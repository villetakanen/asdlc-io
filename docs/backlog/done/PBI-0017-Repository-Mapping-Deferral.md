# PBI-0017 Repository Mapping Deferral

**Status**: TODO

**Description**: The Repository Mapping implementation guide has been deferred to a new Product Backlog Item. This PBI tracks the creation of the guide in a future iteration.

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- Define the scope and format of the Repository Mapping guide.
- Provide example `repository-map.yaml` or equivalent artifact.
- Update relevant documentation and AGENTS.md specification references.

**Notes**: This item was added after the decision to drop the guide from the current iteration. The repository mapping method is deprecated and should be documented under **Concepts** rather than **Practices**.
