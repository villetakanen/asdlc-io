# PBI-0014: Core Implementation Patterns

**ID:** PBI-0014
**Priority:** High
**Effort:** Medium
**Phase:** Iteration 5
**Context:** From Manifesto to Field Manual

## 1. Overview
This PBI focuses on creating concrete engineering artifacts to bridge the gap between the ASDLC Manifesto and a practical Field Manual. It introduces the "Practices" topic and provides specific implementation guides.

## 2. User Story
As a **Developer**, I want **clear, copy-pasteable implementation patterns**, so that **I can apply the ASDLC methodology to my codebase without ambiguity.**

## 3. Implementation Tasks

### 3.1. Repository Mapping Guide
*   [ ] **Create:** `docs/practices/repository-mapping.md` (or similar path)
    *   **Goal:** A guide on how to map a repository to the ASDLC.
    *   **Artifact:** Define the `repository-map.yaml` structure.
    *   **Outcome:** A reader can create a map of their repo.

### 3.2. AGENTS.md Specification
*   [ ] **Create:** `docs/practices/agents-md-spec.md` (or similar path)
    *   **Goal:** The definitive guide to the `AGENTS.md` file.
    *   **Artifact:** A strict schema/template for `AGENTS.md`.
    *   **Outcome:** A reader can create a valid `AGENTS.md` file.

## 4. Acceptance Criteria
*   [ ] "Practices" topic established in documentation structure.
*   [ ] Repository Mapping guide created with concrete examples.
*   [ ] `AGENTS.md` specification created with a usable template.
*   [ ] All guides lead to a committable change.
